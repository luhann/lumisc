## Overview

`lumisc` provides a number of small functions and utilities that I find useful or use regularly, inspired by [Hmisc](https://github.com/harrelfe/Hmisc).

## Installation

Currently the only way to install this package is through GitHub.

```r
# to get the development version from GitHub:
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("luhann/lumisc")
```

If you find a bug, please file a minimal reproducible example in the
[issues](https://github.com/luhann/lumisc/issues). I am grateful for any feedback and/or contributions.

## Current Work

- I am currently working on writing tests for all of the functions already in the package using the [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) package.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions of all types\!

I am currently also using this package as a way to learn R and R package development so any help is greatly appreciated. I encourage typo corrections, bug reports, bug fixes and feature
requests.
